<br>
Context: 
<br>

There are a plethora of AI based projects and ideas over the internet. Whenever a developer works on an idea and nears its completion nothing can surprise them more than to know that a similar version of their idea already exists.
In today's era of digitalization we can also find projects achieving simple tasks on the web and use their framework to achieve bigger ones. But searching for these projects is tiresome work. What could be better than an AI model which provides you with a list of relevant sites? The AI based model, The Ideator, created by Tejasvini Chawla gives a platform to get fast and accurate results for this.
Through this model, one can get a list of relevant websites, through which they can get an insight on how to proceed with their concepts, thus saving time and effort.
<br>
<br>

How it works: <br>

The model first takes an input of an informative title and a description of the project from the user and extracts and stores the keywords from the user’s description. It then searches the title on the web using google API and sorts the sites in the order of most matches found between the keywords of the user’s description and the content of the websites. And this sorted list of sites is then displayed to the user.
